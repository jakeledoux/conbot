# ConBot

A simple library for loading and interacting with Microsoft Personality Chat datasets in TSV form.

You can find those here: https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat

You can also write your own datasets. Just write a file where each line starts with a prompt, then a tab, then the response. You can add further information separated by another tab since this code ignores everything after the first two columns.
